## Project Overview

This project presents an **executive-level sales and profitability dashboard** designed to provide a consolidated view of **revenue performance, customer activity, operational efficiency, and margin structure**.  
The dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor **financial health, growth trends, and cost drivers** through a single, interactive interface.

The analysis focuses on **descriptive and diagnostic business intelligence**, supporting strategic and operational decision-making rather than predictive modelling.

---

## Business Objectives

The dashboard is designed to answer the following key business questions:

- How are sales, orders, and customer volume trending over time?
- What is the current profitability position across key financial ratios?
- Which customer segments contribute the highest gross profit margin?
- How are operational costs distributed across major expense categories?
- Are sales growth and profitability aligned?

- **Total Sales:** $3.2M  
- **Total Orders:** 21,867  
- **Total Customers:** 2,726  
- **Total Returns:** 1,674  

These KPIs provide a high-level snapshot of commercial scale and operational load.

- **Corporate:** 24%  
- **Home:** 16%  

This highlights which customer groups generate the highest margin contribution and supports **segment prioritisation strategies**.
